# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – My super class was Ice Cream Shop and my two subclasses were IceCream and Cake.
- **Declare instance variables** – The instance variables in my superclass is flavorname and price which are also used in the subclasses. In my two subclasses, I used boolean hasCone and hasBowl for my ice cream class. For my Cake class I used hasFrosting and nunmOfLayers as an integer.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

Write a description of your project here. Include what your store you made, and why you chose this topic. In your description, include as many vocab words from our class to explain how you represented the item/service from your store. If you have user input, explain how the user will interact with your store such as which questions are prompted to the user, what response is your program expecting, and how that is use to output information for your store in the console.

My project was about what the user wants in my ice cream shop business. I created one superclass and two subclasses where my super class was Ice Cream Shop and my two subclasses were IceCream and Cake. I had instance variables controlling the items that were listed in the shop where the instance variables in my superclass is flavorname and price which are also used in the subclasses. In my two subclasses, I used boolean hasCone and hasBowl for my ice cream class. For my Cake class I used hasFrosting and nunmOfLayers as an integer. Although I didn't use a scanner class, to input information into the console, you need to give information on what you want into the instantiated object.
